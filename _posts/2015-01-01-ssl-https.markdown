<p>Happy New Year everybody. Good Code 2015. So, back to work i figure out how can i run my dev blog here on github over https. After some Searches i found out. there is a simple script from Eric Mill. This Code based on Javascript. </p>


<code>var host = "YOURDOMAIN.github.io";
if ((host == window.location.host) && (window.location.protocol != "https:"))
    window.location.p
    rotocol = "https";
</code><br>


<h2 class="section-heading">Install</h2>

<p>But it on your Top in the Header after some meta tags.</p>



<blockquote>Good Things never ending!</blockquote>
