<p>Happy New Year Everybody. Good Code 2015. 1. of January! Back to work! i figure out how can i run my dev blog here on github over https. After searching the Entire! I found out, there is a simple script open sourced by Eric Mill. This Code based on Javascript. </p>


<code>var host = "YOURDOMAIN.github.io";
if ((host == window.location.host) && (window.location.protocol != "https:"))
    window.location.protocol = "https";
</code><br>


<p> Another Way you can get ssl is, during the Popular cryptographic software library Open Source SSL which on is available on a Source Base !
	Be aware of the the most big Hole! The Heartbleed Bug! 
	There are many other Open Sources and Scripts. If you are good, you can both write your own self. 
	Here some Links :
