<h2 class="section-heading">Funny Conversations</h2>

Sometimes i love my Conversations during the Web Processes, because it's not everytime Hard work, you need sometimes to make a short break and talks about somethings, etc. There are some very funny Conversations. Maybe i will gonna upload some very funny Screenshoots of my Conversations during the Skype and Web Dev. 

Because i use now the Validator from w3.org to see the failures and errors in the front end. After Page Check of Lea Verou and Mary. >>

<blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
