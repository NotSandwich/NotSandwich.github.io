[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)


Since, we work on our Start Up we use some Tools to work Faster on it.

I'm a Macuser and Work on Mac, with GitHub UI/ Desktop App for Commits and Synch my Changes on our App which one we have Branched. We have also 3 Clones up.

My Friend use Linux and there are also some Differents Way to work on it. Specially we use sails.js for our App.
We also work on ".ejs", files, but they are basically html.


In case you still can't see any updates :


git pull origin master

sudo npm update

sails lift


git add -A -> add all unstaged files to the stagin area
git commit -m "Short description of your commit" -> Commit 


the files from the staging area to the head of your local branch



git checkout {Branch Name}

to check where you are -> git status

 if you want to push -> git push origin {Branch Name}

<blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
