<h2 class="section-heading">Chrome YouTube cast_sender.js console error</h2>

Now, I'm working on my New Blog today [SpaceG](https://spaceg.github.io), after finish my new Design  i have checked out the Console about javascript Errors! There are some Bug from You Tube Javascript, in the www-embed-player.js file of Google and You Tube. Excat this line, which shows up in the console. <code> function Wj(a){return"chrome-extension://"+a+"/cast_sender.js"} </code>

This is a Terrible Thing from oYouTube Javascript. And wish i could fix this bug. Now after i google About it and ask someone in my Network about this Problem, i found on Stackoverflow a Answer. :  [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814914/chrome-youtube-cast-sender-js-console-error)

This is Terrible because nobody download this Cast App [Google Cast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd) 


This is for me.. liek a Bug in Whole Hole. Anyway! Only Way, to have it without Error, i do not embed YOuTube Videos in My Blog, but i want to show Up how to Know How and Give Users Tips durring the Videos Like Installing Videos etc. I Have foudn Another forum about this kind of a Problem. [My Twitter Status](https://twitter.com/LucasGatsas/status/557185085699809280) and here [My Twitter Status](https://twitter.com/LucasGatsas/status/557184382742831104). Gosh Thanks I'm not the Only one with this Kind One. Maybe Google and YouTube have to Slove this Problem. Because it's distrub to work on, even do you don't know from where it's come. 

Happy Coding!
