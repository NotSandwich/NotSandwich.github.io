This is my Punsh- Card at GitHub, i got a Culture Shock about myself :)! Okey, i think this Statitic say everything. 
I believe in good Work and good Learning everyday Code and write everyday code till your fingers are blue. ;) !

Specialy i love to work in a Team, this is so funny :)! For me, when i beginn to Code, i have to wait until i have my rest and the perfect mood and energy to change my Work Modus to 100%. - Then i can spend hours on hours until i say i need to sleep right now:)! 

This can sometimes 24 hours to 32 Hours non stop on a Code. i will write most down until i go sleep, because every next day is another day and the Motivation is sometimes not the same. i know this feeling, better you write it in a step down, then do you have rest and can do other details on the code, project or start up or whatevery do you right now on work it. -
