Crazy how the Times goes on. Since then i have worked already everyday on our Start Up. Now we are in the middle of it. I have done the most Front-End Work and Javascript details. Now i will beginn the Hardwork on the Design, which one need to much Time. I have only spend 10 Hours into the Layout. Then after i choose the main colors, then the Fonts, which one i have change tausend of Times. And good design, i think will never end, becuase the Design looks everyday better and I'm really work on a Commerce Layout.  </p>
