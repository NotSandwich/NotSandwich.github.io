<h2 class="section-heading">Work Static</h2>


<p>Our Work Static Time in Hours till now. Since exact from the 1. of January till now i have spend alot of Time in our Start Up. I had laid the Seeds excat from the 1. of January 2015, crazy how the Times goes on, since then i have worked already everyday on our Start Up. Now we are in the middle, happy to have the strong part behind me. I have done the most Front-End Work and Javascript details. Now i will beginn the Hardwork of the Design which one need to much Time. I have only spend 10 Hours into the Layout, then after choose the main colors, then the Fonts which one i have change thousand of Times already. And a good design need still alot of Time and Work, this sounds to me  will never end, because the Design looks everyday better. - </p>



<p>
And my Day look like so in moment, Wake Up in The Morning most time (07:00), if I slept, because since the last days i'm work at day and night, because i love my work much and can even spend more Time in our Start Up. My Ryhtmus for sleep is 6 - 8 Hours per Day. Nothing more.. i can't even sleep more than 6 -8 Hours per Day. i Stay up, check some News and speak with my mate Giancarlo about the next details on our App. After alot of talking and set some new Goals, i make coffee and think about the next Work Process. Then i check my incoming Mails then i work again again on the Start Up till the Evening. Write some New Code and do re-design of the current Layout. etc.

Between Start Up and Study. 
Some People ask me everytime, how do you can work so long..? my answer is, i do love what i doing, this is the most secret. find something that do you love and make it very big. - this is always a good mood to work on my Start Up. - i don't know.. i think i wish have a bit more time for other things. - but sometimes i realize that's is everything what i have. - and i use all to capitalize everything! even do you have nothing. - (Digital World). I am athlete and have simply by nature much more energy in me. I love create things which one are never done before. - And you must be also too very concentrated, flexible, bouncy, disciplined to be a good Front-End Web Weveloper/ Ui/Ux Interface Developer.
