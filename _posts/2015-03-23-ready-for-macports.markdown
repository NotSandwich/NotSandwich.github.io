<h2 class="section-heading">2.2.1. OS X Package Install</h2>




The OS X package installer automatically installs MacPorts, [sets the shell environment](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.shell.html), and runs a selfupdate operation to update the ports tree and MacPorts base with the latest release.


(1.) Download the latest <strong>MacPorts-2.3.1-....pkg</strong> installer from the MacPorts download directory. Here are direct links for the latest versions of OS X:


OS X 10.9 Mavericks:
[MacPorts-2.3.1-10.9-Mavericks.pkg](https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.1-10.9-Mavericks.pkg)


OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion:
[MacPorts-2.3.1-10.8-MountainLion.pkg](https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.1-10.8-MountainLion.pkg)


OS X 10.7 Lion:
[MacPorts-2.3.1-10.7-Lion.pkg](https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.1-10.7-Lion.pkg)


(2.) Double-click the downloaded package installer to perform the default “easy” install.

(3.) After this step you are done already, MacPorts is now installed and your shell environment was set up automatically by the installer. To confirm the installation is working as expected, now try using the port command in a new terminal window.
