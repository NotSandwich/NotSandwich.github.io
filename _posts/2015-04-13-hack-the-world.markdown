Can you still remember your first "Hello World" ? I was listimg that Radio Stream [Essjay - Who YOu Are?](https://www.mixcloud.com/EssjayK/essjay-k-in-the-mix-x-who-you-are-0910-139bpm-123h-lenght-progressive/listeners/) . How Awesome was that.? And Now.? 
I have learned so much! Thanks for the support and the digital friendship with many developers worldwide. My network could be even greater.
