If you have problems starting up nginx, a common problem is that the port that nginx is configured to listen to is already in use. If you changed the port to <code>80</code>, then this could be an Apache web server or Skype, for instance.

Should you need to stop nginx, then you can do so with the below command.

<code>sudo nginx -s stop</code>

As you have seen, nginx is very simple to install and set up on OS X Yosemite!
