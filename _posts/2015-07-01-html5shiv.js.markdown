<h2 class="section-heading">"html5shiv is an HTML5 JavaScript shim for IE to recognise and style the HTML5 elements"</h2>

HTML5Shiv is a JavaScript library that allows the new HTML5 elements in Internet Explorer to use (all versions) and to format with style information.
HTML5Shiv generates the HTML5 elements and newly occupied them according to style information.
Thus, it is at last no longer necessary tons of <code> <div> </code> elements installed, but we can rely on Standardized elements like <code> <header> </code>,  <code>  <article> </code> or <code> <nav> </code>.



example : 
<code>
  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/r29/html5.min.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->
</code>
