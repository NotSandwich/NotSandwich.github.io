<h2 class="section-heading">"html5shiv is an HTML5 JavaScript shim for IE to recognise and style the HTML5 elements"</h2>

HTML5Shiv is a JavaScript library that allows the new HTML5 elements in Internet Explorer to use (all versions) and to format with style information.
HTML5Shiv generates the HTML5 elements and newly occupied them according to style information.
Thus, it is at last no longer necessary tons of <code> <div> </code> elements installed, but we can rely on Standardized elements like <code> <header> </code>,  <code>  <article> </code> or <code> <nav> </code>.



Example : 


/*

 <!-- [if lt IE 9]>

< script src=" //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/r29/html5.min.js "> </ script>

 <![endif] -->

*/


Javascript Example : 

/*

 <!--[if lt IE 9]>
 <script type="text/javascript">
jQuery.ajaxSetup({
    dataFilter: function(data, dataType) {
        if (typeof innerShiv === 'function' && dataType === 'html') {
            return innerShiv(data);
        }
        else {
            return data;
        }
    }
  }); 

  < /script>
    <![endif]-->

<blockquote>
“Prior to version 9 of Internet Explorer there was little to no support for HTML5 elements and other HTML5 features.[1]

Internet Explorer commands a large percentage of the usage share of web browsers. Within the Internet Explorer percentage, most of its current usage as of February 2013 comes from version 9, with version 8 holding the second-highest and version 7 the third-highest value.[2] With its high usage percentage, it is important to ensure that web pages function correctly in Internet Explorer. HTML5Shiv allows versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9 to recognize the HTML5 tags and allows them to be styled using CSS.”
