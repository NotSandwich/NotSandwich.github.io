to install Emacs 24. The MacPorts installer updates your PATH environment variable, so the MacPorts build of Emacs should be found by your shell before the (outdated) build that comes with Mac OS when you type <strong>'emacs'</strong>. If you prefer the Emacs.app build, that's available by executing:


MacPorts

If you have MacPorts installed, you can just do:
Commandline: 

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo port install emacs
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo port install emacs-app
{% endhighlight %}
