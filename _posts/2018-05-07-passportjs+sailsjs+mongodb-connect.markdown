<h1>Step 1: Dependencies</h1>
Before we start, we need to ensure we have all the relevant dependencies installed into our Sails.js project

{% highlight ruby %}

npm i --save mongodb
npm i --save sails-mongo

{% endhighlight %}



Open the datastore.js file and but in this demo Code to connection the database and write your first entry down. 



{% highlight ruby %}
/**
 * Datastores
 * (sails.config.datastores)
 *
 * A set of datastore configurations which tell Sails where to fetch or save
 * data when you execute built-in model methods like `.find()` and `.create()`.
 *
 *  > This file is mainly useful for configuring your development database,
 *  > as well as any additional one-off databases used by individual models.
 *  > Ready to go live?  Head towards `config/env/production.js`.

  * Your app's default datastore.                                            *
  *                                                                          *
  * Sails apps read and write to local disk by default, using a built-in     *
  * database adapter called `sails-disk`.  This feature is purely for        *
  * convenience during development; since `sails-disk` is not designed for   *
  * use in a production environment.                                         *

  * To use a different db _in development_, follow the directions below.     *
  * Otherwise, just leave the default datastore as-is, with no `adapter`.    *
  *                                                                          *

    * 2. Install it as a dependency of your Sails app.                         *
    *    (For example:  npm install sails-mysql --save)                        *

    * 3. Then pass it in, along with a connection URL.                         *
    *    (See https://sailsjs.com/config/datastores for help.)                 *
    *                                                                          *
