Angular 6 is announced recently which has introduced some pretty awesome features.

Let us see how to create Angular 6 application with and without using .Net Core SPA templates using Visual Studio 2017.

There are more than one ways to create Angular 6 application with .Net Core, Let us see some of them.

Make sure you have instilled Visual Studio 2017 & .Net Core latest SDK and of course Node & Angular CLI.

Without using SPA Template
In this approach we will not use any template and will add Angular 6 within an API project.

Create the Angular application using .Net Core 2.0 template in VS 2017
Once you have all these installed, open your Visual Studio 2017 -> Create New Project -> Select Core Web application:



<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang9.png" alt="">



Click on Ok and in next window, select API as shown below:

<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang10.png" alt="">


Once the API project is created, open Command prompt and navigate to the project folder -> run command:

ng new ClientApp

This will create Angular 6 application within API project.

Next task is to run our Angular application with .Net Core. For this we need to add some code within Startup.cs class.

Add below lines in ConfigureService method:

{% highlight ruby %}


services.AddSpaStaticFiles(configuration =>
{
configuration.RootPath = "ClientApp/dist";
});

{% endhighlight %}



Add below lines in Configure method:



{% highlight ruby %}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseSpaStaticFiles();
 
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseMvc();
 
app.UseSpa(spa =>
{
spa.Options.SourcePath = "ClientApp";
 
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
spa.UseAngularCliServer(npmScript: "start");
}
});

{% endhighlight %}


Above code adds required configuration for running Angular code with .Net Core.

Note: Make sure the property “launchUrl”: “api/values” is not present in the Properties/launchSettings.json, if it is available then delete it.

Just run the application in the browser:

Your Angular 6 application is now running with .Net Core.

With SPA Template
In first approach, we have not used SPA template to create Angular app, in this approach we will use the Angular template.

Create the Angular application using .Net Core 2.1 template in VS 2017
Once you have all these installed, open your Visual Studio 2017 -> Create New Project -> Select Core Web application:




<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang1.png" alt="">


Click on Ok and in next window, select Angular as shown below:



<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang2.png" alt="">





Visual Studio will create a well-structured application for you.

If you compare latest project structure with the previous versions then you would notice that the Views folder is no more there:



<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang3.png" alt="">


We do not need that Views folder now.

Delete ClientApp and install Angular 6
If you open package.json file under ClientApp folder, you would notice the Angular version is 5.0 but we want to create Angular 6 application.

So go to File explorer and delete ClientApp folder:


<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang41.png" alt="">





<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang41.png" alt="">



Once the folder is deleted, open Command prompt and navigate to the project and run command:
{% highlight ruby %}
ng new ClientApp
{% endhighlight %}
This command will create brand new Angular application with latest version.


<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang5.png" alt="">

Once the process is completed, go back to solution explorer -> ClientApp -> package.json file, it should show Angular 6.0 references:


<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang6.png" alt="">

That is it. We have just created Angular 6 application with .Net Core.

Let us try to use any random Angular 6 feature just to make sure we have latest Angular 6 code.



Test Library feature
We will test the library feature which has been shipped with Angular 6.

Open the command prompt again and navigate to ClientApp folder -> run command:

ng generate library my-shared-library


<img class="card-img-top" src="https://spaceg.github.io/assets/images/ang7.png" alt="">
Logs in the window confirms that we have Angular 6 now. Library would be created under the ClientApp -> Projects folder:
