<strong>Step 1. </strong> Set up the Development Environment 
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install Node.jsÂ® and npm if they are not already on your machine.

Let's get start and create a new Angular 6 Project with your Command Line / CLI


Then install the Angular CLI globally.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
{% endhighlight %}


<strong>Step 2. </strong>Create a new project 
Open a terminal window.

Generate a new project and default app by running the following command:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ng new my-app
{% endhighlight %}


The Angular CLI installs the necessary npm packages, creates the project files, and populates the project with a simple default app. This can take some time.


Step 3: Serve the application 
Go to the project directory and launch the server.


{% highlight ruby %}
cd my-app
ng serve --open
{% endhighlight %}

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

Using the --open (or just -o) option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/.

Your app greets you with a message: Welcome to the App.
