Go to your Terminal and Type these following comand Lines : 

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ng g c server 
{% endhighlight %}

and then we create both another component

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ng g c servers 
{% endhighlight %}

or write down the full commandline like: 

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ng generate component server
{% endhighlight %}

it's the same way, like above. but the first variants are the short commandlines of angular 6:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ng generate component servers
{% endhighlight %}

now open your <strong>app.module.ts </strong> and checkout these imported Modules like your component names. you can also include there your favorite modules. !
